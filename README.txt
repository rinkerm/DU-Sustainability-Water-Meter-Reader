This repository contains the files needed to further develop the automatic water meter reader developed for the Denison University Office of Sustainability.
This project was created for our Software Engineering Class taught by Dr. Bressoud. 

This repository consists of five sections:

arduinowiring.png - a pictoral guide for wiring the device 

water _meter.ino - arduino sketch file for a wifiless device which outputs reading to a LCD screen.

water_meter_wifi - an upgraded form of the preceding file which has the added functionality of outputting data to a google form for processing. This works by using the free web service api pushingbox.

ArduinoGuide.pdf - an explanetory file detailing the creation process of the device and how to assemble it

Google Import Scripts - files containing the google scripts code that handles imports to the database
